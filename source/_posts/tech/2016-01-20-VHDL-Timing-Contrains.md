### Path Endpoints are:
-I/O pads
-Synchronous elements:FFs, letches, Rams, DSP slices, SRLs, etc.

### Pathe Endpoints do Not include:
-LUTs
-Nets, or any other asynchronous element

### Constraint Type:

* The PERIOD contraint covers delay paths between synchronous elementes

* The OFFSET IN constraint covers delay paths from input pins to syschronous elements

* The OFFSET OUT constraint covers delay paths form synchronous elements to output pins


setting of constraints depends on the system requirment.
