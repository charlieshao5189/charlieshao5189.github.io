There are still another two monthes left before I reach my first year aniversivery moving and working at Oslo. I have experienced a lot during the first year at Olso. First year ago, I was worry about my job. I konw the life I want is working at Norway, but now I successfully get used to the life in Oslo and I found that this is not the lift I want. I start to think about the new task: finding the life I want, finding the life the make me confortable.
