Are you the manager of the store?

Can I talk to him or her?

I'm an international student coming from China, I heard that you are looking for store 
salesman who can speak chinese. So just wounder can I get a summer job from your company?

cloud you introduce more about yourself?

Yes, of course. I'm study system engineering in University College of Sourth-eastean Norway, the campus in Kongsberg. Honestly speaking, I didn't have any experience about sell? But I do konw how to communicate with customers, I worked as an assistant in mobile phone service center one summer holiday when I study in college for my bachelor degree. You konw customers always complain about their mobilphones, so I had to persuade them to trust us and solve them problem as soon as possible. So I blieve I am capable for the job as a Seller. I know it will be a challenge for me at first, but I think I will try to learn more and conquer the difficulties.So I realy hope to get this job.
