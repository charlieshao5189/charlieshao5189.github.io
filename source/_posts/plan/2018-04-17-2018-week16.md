# 2018-04-16 Mondag skyet
After work, I went to the church. This is my second time went to church for studying Bible. 
One the way coming back to home, I start to think about why I come to church. Here are the reasons I give to myself:
* Meeting people, leaning about the living states of Christians
* Curious about Christian religions
* Many ancient art works are related to Bible stories, so I want to learn the Bible stories to increase my knowledge.
* Explore why religions could survive under morden science based socieity.
* Prtice the capbility of discussing topics, expressing opposite options, defensing my own view point.

When I come back to home, I check the zhihu about how to refute Christian's opinions. Here is the link:

It is a busy day today. I had three meetings with customers, two of them are hold alone by myself, another one is work as a translater.
There was a suprise waiting for me when I come back to home, I got the Norskprøve certification paper, so the results of all reach to A2 are true. I do not have concern anymore.

It is a normal day for work. After Work, I ate a prtty good dinner: two chicken legs, four prawns and half pizza. During dinner, I start watching <The End of the Fxxxing World>, keeping watch until half one hour after dinner, then I had a one hour running and took a shower. After that continute the show and finished it. Then booked Klar Tale avis and watch three video fo Norsk Lærer Karense. Last job before sleeping is finished this diary. What a nice day!

# 2018-04-19 torsdag luft dårlig

Work is work, no chanllenge problems today. After work I went to play football as usual, but I almost broke my foot, so I left before finishing, but I am sure I did not get hurt, at least not very serious. Sushi was today's dinner, but I brough them home, also added one toasted chicken leg. After dinner it was just aroud 6.30pm, so I went to librariy. Today I finnaly got <a brief history of time> that I booked one month ago. I am not sure if I have time to read all of them, but at least I can use this weekend to quickly review this book. I also finished three latest norsk lærer karenser's videos and plan a bit on topics of friday' norsk pratice. 
Before I start writing I suddenly have a concern, will I be alone forever? Maybe If you can not release yourself, move forward and change your mind. Give you best wish!
