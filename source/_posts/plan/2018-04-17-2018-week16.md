After work, I went to the church. This is my second time went to church for studying Bible. 
One the way coming back to home, I start to think about why I come to church. Here are the reasons I give to myself:
* Meeting people, leaning about the living states of Christians
* Curious about Christian religions
* Many ancient art works are related to Bible stories, so I want to learn the Bible stories to increase my knowledge.
* Explore why religions could survive under morden science based socieity.
* Prtice the capbility of discussing topics, expressing opposite options, defensing my own view point.

When I come back to home, I check the zhihu about how to refute Christian's opinions. Here is the link:
